    "# Best Model: LightGBM, with optimized hyperparameters (n_estimators=157, learning_rate≈0.29, max_depth=3), achieved the highest performance (ROC AUC = 0.997, AP = 0.996, F1 = 0.963).\n",
    "# Lesson Learned: For smaller tabular datasets with potential class imbalance, tree-based ensemble methods (LightGBM/XGBoost) tend to outperform linear models by capturing non-linear interactions, while PCA ensures robust dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "# Key Takeaway: Combining systematic preprocessing (Power + Scaling + PCA) with SMOTE and automated hyperparameter tuning (Optuna) can deliver near-optimal results, making the pipeline both high-performing and reproducible."
